<p><b>For example:</b></p>
<p><code>
<a href="http://agrodatacube.wur.nl/api/v1/rest/fields?geometry=POLYGON%20((4.2%2052,%204.2%2053,%204.3%2053,%204.3%2052,%204.2%2052))&epsg=4326&year=2017&cropname=mais&output_epsg=4326">
https://agrodatacube.wur.nl/api/v1/rest/fields?geometry=POLYGON((4.2 52.0, 4.2 53.0, 4.3 53.0, 4.3 52.0, 4.2 52.0))&epsg=4326&year=2017&cropname=mais&output_epsg=4326
</a></code></p>
<p>Will return all crop fields where maize was grown in 2017, within the specified area. This area is given as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text" alt="Well-Known Text">WKT</a> POLYGON geometry, with (long lat) coordinates. The epsg and output_epsg indicate the input and output map coordinate systems to use, <a href="http://epsg.io/4326">epsg 4326</a> is the code for WGS 84, the coordinate system used in GPS. The default coordinate system used by the AgroDataCube is epsg 28992, the Dutch Amersfoort / RD New system. Data will be returned in <a href="http://geojson.org" alt="GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a> format, and you can used paging parameters to request more data. Please see the Postman documentation for other available data types and their requests.</p>
